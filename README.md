a. Name of the project :
Customized Virtual File System

b. Technology used : 
C, C++

c. User interface used :
Command Line Interface

d. platform required :
GNU compiler, Windows, Mac, Linux

e. Hardware requirements :
Minimum 2GB RAM

f. Description of the project: 

In this project we emulate all data structures which are used by operating system to manage File 
system-oriented tasks. As the name suggest its virtual because we maintain all records in Primary storage.
In this project we create all data structures which required for File Subsystems as Inode, Inode Table, File 
Table, UAREA, User File Descriptor Table, Superblock, Disk Inode List Block, Data Block, Boot Block etc. We 
provide all implementations of necessary system calls and commands of File subsystem as Open, Close, 
Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc. While providing the implementations of all above 
functionality we use our own data structures by referring Algorithms of UNIX operating system. By using 
this project, we can get overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any platform
